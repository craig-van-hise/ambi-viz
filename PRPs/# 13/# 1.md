## **Brief: Phase 2 Head Tracking Latency & Integration Validation**

**Subject:** Evaluation of Webcam Head Tracking Prediction (Phase 2) vs. Phase 1 Baselines.

---

### **1. Integration Integrity Check**

* **Verification Requirement:** Confirm whether the Phase 2 codebase for webcam head tracking prediction is actively deployed and functional.
* **The Issue:** Subjective testing suggests no perceptible difference in tracking quality or responsiveness between the Phase 1 and Phase 2 iterations.
* **Risk:** Potential for "Ghost Code" scenario where the system is inadvertently defaulting to Phase 1 logic despite Phase 2 being written.

---

### **2. Latency & Performance Analysis**

* **Current Perceptual Status:** Latency remains above the threshold for user comfort and seamless usability.
* **Metric Benchmarking:**
* **Target Threshold:** ~60ms (Acceptable window for total system latency).
* **Estimated Performance:** ~120ms (Estimated by user; subject to formal verification).


* **User Experience:** The lag between physical head rotation (3DOF orientation) and the corresponding audio/visual response is currently "noticeable" and suboptimal.

---

### **3. Technical Variables for Adjustment**

* **Prediction Look-ahead:** Evaluation of the predictor’s "future-look" window.
* **Latency Compensation:** Exploration of how much aggressive compensation can be applied at the current stage to bring the system within the <60ms threshold.

---

### **4. Tactical Constraints & Next Steps**

* **No Immediate Coding:** Refrain from further script modifications or implementation until a verbal/conceptual alignment is reached.
* **Collaborative Review:** A conversational deep-dive is required to troubleshoot why the "responsiveness" hasn't shifted despite the transition to Phase 2 logic.
