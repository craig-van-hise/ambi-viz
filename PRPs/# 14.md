## **Project Brief: Integration of UI Rotation with Binaural Audio Renderer**

### **Current Progress: Hardware Tracking**

* **Status:** Functional.
* **Implementation:** The Object-Based Renderer (OBR) now successfully receives rotation data from the webcam-based head tracking system.
* **Result:** Real-time head rotation correctly modulates the Ambisonics processing, resulting in accurate spatial audio through the binaural renderer.

### **Immediate Objective: UI/UX Rotation Integration**

The primary goal is to synchronize the visual manipulation of the scene with the audio engine's spatial orientation.

**Functional Requirements:**

* **Input Mapping:** Map the 3-Degrees-of-Freedom (**3DoF**) mouse-driven camera rotation to the audio engine.
* **Synchronization:** Ensure that manual on-screen camera rotation (visual) triggers a corresponding rotation in the audio output (auditory).
* **Technical Bridge:** Establish a connection between the UI's rotation state and the rotation input parameters of the **OBR-WASM** module.

### **System Architecture & Data Flow**

| Component | Input Source | Target Component | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hardware Tracking** | Webcam/Head Tracking | OBR-WASM | **Connected** |
| **UI Manipulation** | Mouse / Screen Interaction | Camera Orientation | **Connected** |
| **Audio Sync** | **Camera Orientation** | **OBR-WASM Rotation Inputs** | **Pending** |

---

### **Key Takeaways & Next Steps**

* **Current State:** Visuals rotate independently via mouse interaction, but audio remains static relative to the UI camera.
* **Handoff Task:** Bridge the UI rotation logic to the `obr-wasm` handler to ensure the binaural renderer reflects the user's manual 3DoF screen adjustments.
